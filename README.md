# Imaginary Dragon Auctions (Shop like app)

### Built with flutter and firebase for android (would also work on iOS and web with current flutter version and minior edits).


I have built this app as a part of my "learning tour with flutter".


## It includes the following functionality:


### App side

- Authentication with firebase
- Connection to firebase's realtime database to fetch and post data (users' auctions)
- Route guarding
- Custom user interface (each user can see their own created auctions in separate card and edit them there, it is also possible to "favorite" tag auctions created by others)
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Sidebar and cards navigation
- Animated buttons
- Accepting images in google storage through the node js function on firebase functions


### Dev side

- Properly refactored code
- State management with scoped-model
